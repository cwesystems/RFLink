# RFLink

This is a fork of the RFLink project, hosted earlier on Sourceforge. The original project has gone closed-source and the sourceforge page does not contain the code anymore.

### What is changed
* Changed "#include" for plugins so it works with relative paths.
* Cleaned upp some files and put them in a directory called "Old".
* Fixed the code so it will compile
* The original "README" file is renamed to "README_old".

### Version
At the time of download (2015-11-30) the sourceforge version was R34 but the readme-file showed R29. 
See, "README_old" for original readme file.

### Links to the original project
* [RFLink Sourceforge] - RFLink on Sourceforge
* [RFLink homepage] - Homepage for RFLink
